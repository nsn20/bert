The goal here is not to determine effectiveness, but to gauge the safety of various doses and determine what kind of immune response to expect at different doses in order to inform phase 2 and 3. That is why you don’t have a control group for this phase, you need data specifically about the human body’s response to the vaccine at various dosage levels. \\n\\nBased on this data they’ll likely pick a single dose that appears to cause the right immune response and then move into controlled trials with larger groups. The only way you could move faster would be challenge trials, intentionally infecting test subjects, but that is unethical.', 'Just to add one more thing, the blind studies will be done at phase 3.\\n\\nEdit: some development groups are adding them at phase 2 as well.\\n\\nEdit2: this specific data is from CanSino and they will also be doing double blind studies in their phase 2. [if you want more info on how they are laying out their study. ](https://www.trialsitenews.com/cansino-biologics-ad5-ncov-the-first-covid-19-vaccine-to-phase-ii-clinical-trials/)', 'Phase 2 trials are typically blinded as well.', 'It really depends on what you\\'re doing. I don\\'t work in clinical trials but I do work in developing the manufacturing process of new drugs where the clinical strategy consists of the milestones we need to meet (i.e. you want clinical trials to be the slowest part of drug development- when they are done, you want to already have figured out how to make the thing in a safe, effective way, both to supply the clinical trials with drug and also to make sure there\\'s no major change in manufacturing between what you supplied during clinical trials and what you produce commercially)\\n\\nAnyway, the current drug I\\'m working on skipped Phase II all together and Phase III isn\\'t even blinded. That\\'s because our strategy is to essentially say \"this product has the same effectiveness as this other product\" and mainly, its a new route of administration. \\n\\nI\\'ve also seen cancer drugs combine Phase II and Phase III. Those are typically blinded, but the control group is always \"standard of care\", not saline solution, because its also unethical to treat someone with a time sensitive deadly disease with essentially nothing. This also means that the new drug typically has to out perform the standard of care, although initially at least, its tested either in combination with other standard of care drugs, or its tested as a \"third line treatment\", meaning the cancer has come back 3 times and normal medications haven\\'t been effective. Both situations can be challenging to see efficacy in a new drug.', 'I\\'m running some open label oncology trials right now. One is a CRC where there is a treatment arm and a \"watchful waiting\" arm, which is essentially standard of care. I see quite a few oncology trials comparing investigational drug vs SOC, with no placebo. It\\'s actually a problem sometimes because people want the drug, and if they are assigned non-investigational arm they might leave the study. Assignment is random, but everyone knows who is on what.', '[deleted]', '[deleted]', \"I feel like that's where you blind the patients and give them placebo, just to ensure patient retention in the study! But blinding and placebo treatments are not always as straightforward as they sound.\", \"Well, patients in the non-treatment arm are often still getting more frequent and more intimate health monitoring, so it's not a total wash. Plus the altruism aspect. But often the time that's needed to dedicate to the study to come in for visits, etc, is too much for a patient for various reasons, whereas being on a drug often provides more incentive to stay.\\n\\nBut I was once on a study for a rare condition. There wasn't really any approved treatments available (some off label stuff) and it was a pretty messed up disease. The patient community was all about trying to get on this trial, but at the end we *still* had issues with people dropping out early to the point we had concerns about the sample size for statistical analysis. The length of the study (a few years, I believe), just meant that people had lots of things get in the way and they had to leave the study for one reason or another. Recruitment can be hard, but people seem to forget about retention even more when they plan these things. \\n\\nThat's where I come in, to try and make sure we take that into account and mitigate what we can as early as possible. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. It's a constant battle to get sponsors to pay for things when they're convinced they won't be a problem, even though a significant number of studies struggle with these things. Pay now or pay more later. They seem to go for the latter more often than not.\", \"You missed the unethical part of giving a placebo to someone who's about to die.\", 'No, the control is \"standard of care\". In this situation, standard of care is doing nothing, and waiting. Clinical trials are typically \"standard of care\" v \"new drug\" (sometimes \"new drug + standard of care\").\\n\\nMy comment was really that if the control v experimental arms of the study are too different in terms of administrating the drug, people will drop out because they don\\'t want the standard of care, they want some new drug - they think its more effective than standard of care, but frankly that hasn\\'t been proven yet (and there may be side effects that make taking that new drug actually causes more harm than benefit).\\n\\nIn this particular situation, standard of care is waiting, so they drop out because they can wait on their own, without going through the extra monitoring (and frankly, paid-for/free doctor visits)\\n\\nEdit: there are also situations, i forget what they\\'re officially called, where the patient will die anyway, and so they are allowed to try a new, unapproved medication in case it works. But thats not the situation the original comment was describing.', \"> there are also situations, i forget what they're officially called, where the patient will die anyway, and so they are allowed to try a new, unapproved medication in case it works.\\n\\nCompassionate Use / Expanded Access. It's a great program, but it's not really something we can base science on. It has, however, saved or prolonged quite a few individual lives\", \"You're right, it's a pretty difficult problem. The wording on the comment made me think you completely ignored the previous posts, so I jumped to a snarky remark.\", \"If the experimental group starts showing marked indepedent improvement you stop the study and give all involved the option to start whatever you're testing. This is testing ethics 101, they drill this into you.\\n\\nSource: psychology degree\", \"Question: when the other arm is standard of care why is there a need for such an arm? Don't we have enough data at this point on the standard of care that we don't need to keep it as part of the study? Are there any studies that have looked for any delta between various standard of care arms?\\n\\nE.g. Hospital A and Hospital B have 2 different trials for the same disease. Both are comparing against the standard of care. Hospital A is slightly better funded than Hospital B. How different are the results in the standard of care arms, and (more importantly) does that begin to average out when spread across many varying hospitals?\", 'Enrolling patients in a concurrently running standard of care arm is about having a group of patients who have statistically similar demographics to your treatment arm at the same point in time over the same period of time and performing the same monitoring for the duration of the study as you conducting for those in the treatment arm. The aim is to attempt to reduce as many variables as possible, whether it’s the health of your subjects (so randomization should ensure everything averages out between the two groups) or if socioeconomic status is coming in to play (so in your example, funding at the two hospitals may indicate a location difference and a population health difference) or if other factors are having an affect that you discover in your research. \\n\\nSo even though we have tons of experience with the standard of care treatments, it may not always be that we have that published data as well. The only times we have published data is when we do these studies. A comparator ensures that the results mean something as well.', 'To add to your third paragraph, the FDA has special drug development designations, one of which is called \"breakthrough therapy\". It\\'s for drugs that treat serious conditions that show promise to greatly improve on currently available treatments, and a breakthrough therapy is eligible to be fast tracked through the FDA approval process. The method of clinic trials you described sounds like how they would test one of these breakthrough therapies.', \"Yeah, that's why MDMA (colloquially called ecstacy) is going through trials so fast.\", 'I do work on and design clinical trials, though not vaccine trials, and it\\'s why I said \"typically.\" There are indications and designs that don\\'t call for phase 2 studies at all, and a myriad of designs that combine phase 2 and 3.\\n\\nFor a brand new therapeutic such as this vaccine, blinded and placebo controlled trials will be essential to determine efficacy. In order to achieve the fastest label authorization, phase 2 trials will be an important component of the submission to regulatory agencies, so it\\'s essential that those be designed rigorously as \"smaller scale\" phase 3 studies (or adaptive 2/3 designs, etc).', 'Yeah. I can definitely see a situation where an unblinded trial for covid causes subjects to stop using any additional social distancing or protective equipment precautions, which could potentially skew the results in a significant way!', 'is there still a need for placebo if the immune response is very definitive and unlikely to be affected by vector only? I am not an expert, just curious.', 'I’m talking specifically for the current rush to get the corona virus vaccine. I’ve only read about the plans for a few of the groups working on the development, but it seems like they are all addressing placebos in phase 3. Just wanted to point it out so people don’t expect to see it until then.\\n\\nEdit oops: moderna is in fact starting it in phase 2. I have to go read some more. Hopefully more than one of these groups are successful and we can have a ton of vaccines by the end of the year.', 'They can be but it really depends. Sometimes P2 is used to see if it works on the specific condition while P3 is about efficacy compared to a placebo\\nI’m a medical researcher and I’ve seen it both ways.', 'I thought blinded studies were to negate any placebo effects that might be conveyed if the researchers knew who was receiving the real drug.\\n\\nWhat is the benefit to blinding a study on vaccine efficacy?', 'It does seem a little useless, but you still want to be able to say that the volunteers developed these antibodies due to the vaccine and not environmental factors. And if there is a side effect  that seems to be in the control group as well, then there is something else going on and it may not be the vaccine causing it.', 'Challenge trials are not prima facie unethical but do beg the question of what constitutes informed consent when there is, basically, really muddy information to consent to.', 'Good point. COVID-19 still has a nebulous set of possible symptoms, from purple toes to death.', '[removed]', \"Since I don't know if this means you haven't heard about the toes thing before or not. Toes turning purple is a result of a blood clot cutting off flow and leading to Acute Critical Limb Ischemia in the worst case. It has been noted that it seems COVID-19 increases blood coagulation in which has significantly increased things like Stroke, Heart Attack, CLI, etc in people who have it. I need to go digging for the report, but what I heard from the director at Mt. Sinai in NY is that people under 50 seemed to have ~3x increase in stroke. I'm not sure on the rates for the other ones. Their response there was blood thinners as a standard course of treatment for many patients to reduce the chance they have those things happen.\", \"In very severe cases it can cause purple fingers. If that happens, go to the ER immediately. Both fingers and toes are a form of pseudohypothermia from the microclots. Appendages are more likely to have this due to an array of small blood vessels so clotting is easier.\\n\\nIf your body isn't strong enough to clear the microclots from COVID-19 in your fingers, things are not good at all. Thankfully, it is far more rare.\", \"Why isn't aspirin prescribed at detection if this is the case?\", \"Some do prescribe aspirin. There is also a clinical trial investigating asprin for COVID.

My guess: expect the same protection for vaccine manufacturers so they'll be willing to skip standard safety checks.\\n\\nI'm not antivax by any measure, but I'm not going to be taking a vaccine that comes with a lawsuit shield any quicker than I'll be buying a brand new car without a warranty.\", \"That's already true in the US. Vaccines are the only drug for which the manufacturer can't be sued for an injury. Instead, people can seek compensation through the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a federal program that pays out roughly $230M/yr to claimants.\", \"Look at the AIDS crisis. It's exactly what you're proposing and had people do very desperate things. It caused a hell of a lot of changes in the way the FDA reviewed medications, too. HIV, left untreated, will kill almost everyone who catches it. Not even the bubonic plague is as deadly. It only kills about 60% of the people it infects if left untreated.\\n\\nVaccine development has already been accelerated for this pandemic. The ethical standards have changed a lot since the 1950s, but we're still going to probably get this vaccine out faster than the polio vaccine (and here I mean from the first clinical trials to the roll-out of the first one that works). Also, we can develop medications much faster, too, again thanks to the research developed to combat AIDS.\", 'I’ve read some answers that say that we’ll infect people in poor countries which I honestly doubt. What’s more likely to happen is that in a second wave, the researchers will locate an epicenter and vaccinate uninfected people nearby, that way people are likely to get the virus, but aren’t purposely infected. \\n\\nIt’s a interesting trade off though, when you relax ethical restraints, science can move faster. So you can save many by hurting the few. I’d assume these restrictions would be relaxed only in the case that we face a virus that would wipe out a more significant portion of the population (not saying that 1% isn’t a ton of people, but we’re not at risk of extinction)\\n\\nIn regards to skipping animal trials, I’m not sure if you already know this but Moderna did just that. While animal trials are being done by the NIH I’m pretty sure, they were not done prior to dosing humans. This was done because their vaccine platform is safe in humans, but there are some immunological features of coronaviruses that would warrant animal trials. Assuming the government and Moderna knows those risks, they must have made that trade off in order to try to speed through trials. Hoping that the possibility of enhanced disease in some will be outweighed by immunity in the many.', \">I’ll take a morale boost anywhere I can get it.\\n\\nOkay, take another morale boost from me: You're doing great and your friends really like you!\\n\\nNow get out of here, you scamp. :)\", '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', '[removed]', 'There are many versions of a vaccine being tested.

I’m not an expert so I’m not sure exactly how much that would make a difference, but I know +ssRNA has one less step upon entering a host cell than -ssRNA. \\n\\nAre there any viruses infecting humans that have antigenic drift comparable to influenza though?', 'I’m not sure either, but I don’t believe there would be a large difference caused by positive/negative sense. Positive has to convert to negative and back to positive, but in terms of how this would affect antigenic drift I have no idea. Both are the senses you say they are.
